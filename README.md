A database of software tools for the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data. To
make it into the database software must be available for download and public use
somewhere (CRAN, Bioconductor, PyPI, Conda, GitHub, Bitbucket, a private website
etc). To view the database head to https://www.scRNA-tools.org.

## Purpose

This database is designed to be an overview of the currently available scRNA-seq
analysis software, it is unlikely to be 100% complete or accurate but will be
updated as new software becomes available.

## Contributing
